## remember
Solve the problem of always forgetting some useful commands. such as how to use `scp`, how to find the centos issue's version by shell, and how to use the `vim` to view files on linux platform.

Eventually, Save time to view the notes on webpages or your private notebooks.

## design
1.Write notes with markdown format.

2.Read markdown filenames, then details to find target commands.

## commands
```sh
# 显示所有的文件名称
remember ls
# 显示文件内容
remember show <文件名称>
```
